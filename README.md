The idea is to simulate the 40K 10th edition and maybe train a neural network to see how it performs to play this game.

Once game rules are implemented and usable, the aim is to:
1. Train a neural net to play this game
  a. Neural net selects army based on points
  b. Neural net should then play turn based game to either a) eliminates opponent, b) captures objectives until time runs out or c) loses
  c. See if metagame strategies that are currently in use are re-discovered, or novel strategies arise.
