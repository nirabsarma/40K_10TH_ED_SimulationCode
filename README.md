The idea is to simulate the 40K 10th edition and maybe train a neural network to see how it performs to play this game.

Once game rules are implemented and usable, the aim is to:
1. Train a neural net to play this game
- Neural net selects army based on points, map geometry and objectives.
- Neural net should then play turn based game to either a) eliminates opponent, b) captures objectives until time runs out or c) loses
2. See if metagame strategies that are currently in use are re-discovered, or novel strategies arise.
3. Implement a UI for testing user strategies against AI opponents

The idea comes from observing wargaming systems on youtube, where statistical data, randomness and positioning play a key role in large scale tactics. e.g. Command: Modern Operations, AI War 2,
